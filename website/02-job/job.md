### Hello! I'm looking for new temporary job on projects.


When i worked on <strong>NetCracker</strong> (NEC department), i worked with oracle servers from <strong>Russia, Europe, Australia, Canada, America, India</strong>.

When i worked on RosBank, i worked with oracle servers from <strong>all regions from Russia</strong>.


Unfortunately, i have no any visa to work in the USA, Canada, Europe and if you'll want to suggest me on international project, please help me with visa before.


I can work remotely as Java, PL/SQL Developer or admin application servers Wildfly (Jboss), Weblogic and of course i can work with Oracle Database.

I think position as <strong>NetCracker Oracle DBA / NetCracker Application Admin</strong> could be interesting for companies, who bought <strong>NetCracker</strong>.

If my person would be interesting, send me emai.<br/>
Thanks.
