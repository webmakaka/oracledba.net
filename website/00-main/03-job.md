# Hello! I'm looking for new temporary job on projects.

When I'm worked on <strong>NetCracker</strong> (NEC department), I'm worked with oracle servers from <strong>Russia, Europe, Australia, Canada, America, India</strong>.

When I worked on RosBank, I worked with oracle servers from <strong>all regions from Russia</strong>.

Unfortunately, I have no any visa to work in the USA, Canada, Europe and if you'll want to suggest me on international project, please help me with visa before.

I can work remotely as Java, PL/SQL Developer or admin application servers Wildfly (Jboss), Weblogic and of course i can work with Oracle Database.

Now i work on project as Oracle ADF developer. We develop cloud application with interface <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFdW4_nne0A">like this</a> for retail companies.

I think position as <strong>NetCracker Oracle DBA / NetCracker Application Admin</strong> could be interesting for companies, who bought <strong>NetCracker</strong>.

I agree for with salary something about \$2000. Earlier I can earn this salary in the Russia. But now I can't.

If my person would be interesting, send me email.<br/>

Thanks.
