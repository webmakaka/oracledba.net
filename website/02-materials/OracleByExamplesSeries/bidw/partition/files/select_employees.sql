REM Virtual column-based partitioning
REM 1.Introduce the concept of a virtual column (e.g. Extract the month out of a date)
REM 2.Create a simple virtual column and select from it (you can also highlight that you can collect stats on such a column)
REM 3.Create a virtual column-based partitioned table (for demonstration purposes this can be something goofy like adding two column values or so)
REM 4.insert some data and show the data placement based on the virtual column definitions
